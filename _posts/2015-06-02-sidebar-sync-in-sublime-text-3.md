One of the things that I love about [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) is the "Autoscroll to Source" and "Autoscroll from Source" depicted below:

And Sublime Text 3 doesn't have this functionality natively.  But you can add it pretty easily with the [SyncedSideBar](https://github.com/sobstel/SyncedSideBar) plugin available through Package Control.

As a matter of fact, it's working brilliantly while I'm writing this blog post.  Here is a cropped screenshot of what I see (this post is highlighted at the bottom left side of the image):

Having the file you're currently focused on highlighted in the sidebar is amazingly helpful when you have a significantly large codebase.  Or if you don't have a significantly large codebase.  It pretty much helps you no matter what kind of codebase you're working inside :)
