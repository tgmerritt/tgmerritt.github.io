I am a self-taught developer.  I hold a degree in English language from UWF.  If I can teach myself how to code, be professionally employed as a programmer, and build and deploy my own applications - anyone can.  I'm about the furthest thing you could be from an engineer.  I don't like mathematics.  I truly hate the hardcore computer science they teach at most Universities.  I'll steal from DHH - but I consider myself a "Software Writer".  

I like to spend time with my family, write code, snowboard, scuba dive, and travel.  Video games are also a passion - if you're playing VainGlory on the iPhone - hit me up!
